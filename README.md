# Mines

A multiplayer minesweeper clone written in BlitzMax. Features include the ability to play on a wrapped minefield, and online play over TCP/IP. 

The project in its current state has been tested to build and run on OS X and Windows 7.

## History

Going by the file date timestamps, it looks like I wrote a first version in 2007 and then upgraded it a bit in 2009.
