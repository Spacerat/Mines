# Mines

A multiplayer minesweeper clone written in BlitzMax. Features include the ability to play on a wrapped minefield, and online play over TCP/IP. 

The executable file needs to have the 'res' folder alongside itself, otherwise it will not run.

The project in its current state has been tested to build and run on OS X and Windows 7.

## History

Going by the file timestamps, it looks like I wrote a first version in 2007 and then upgraded it a bit in 2009.
